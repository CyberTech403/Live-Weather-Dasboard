# Application Summary ðŸ“‹

This is a browser-based weather dashboard using OpenWeatherMap APIs, dynamically updating HTML and CSS with weather data from the 5 Day Weather Forecast API; key objectives include API utilization, registration for an API key, constructing API calls and implementing localStorage for data storage.

When a user searches for a city on the weather dashboard, they are presented with the current city weather, including the city name, date, weather icon, temperature, humidity, and wind speed. 

The searched city is added to the search history. Users can view the future weather conditions for a selected city, displayed in a 5-day forecast and clear search history. 
Clicking on a city in the search history allows the user to see the current and future conditions for that city again.
